# Integrations

This folder aims to host a collection of integrations with third-party services. For example, a function here may create an off-chain balances JSON from a list of subscribed users. Ideas for integrations include subscription services, web2/web3 payment handlers, querying external APIs, session handlers, zero-knowledge proofs, and more.
